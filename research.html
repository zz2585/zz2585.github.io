		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">Retail traders can help or hinder the impounding of earnings information into price, but inferences are complicated because retail traders select when, where, and how much to trade. We use trade-level data and exploit retail brokerage outages to provide causal evidence on how retail investors affect the pricing of public earnings information. We find that retail trading is associated with stronger price responses to earnings news during the earnings announcement (EA) window and greater post-earnings announcement drift, but only the EA-window effect is robust to identification using plausibly exogenous outages. Outage-based results are stronger for earnings announcements expected to have high retail activity ex ante. Furthermore, retail buy-sell imbalance during EAs is not associated with price responses to earnings news, inconsistent with retail trade as informed per se. Overall, our evidence is consistent with a model in which retail trade, particularly when it is identifiable to market makers, facilitates liquidity provision to other traders around earnings announcements.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;"> This study examines the impact of financial misconduct announcements on product quality. Using Amazon consumer reviews and difference-in-differences analyses, we show that product quality significantly improves for fraud firms after the announcements. The observed effect is stronger when the media coverage is more extensive, and for products are either high-volume or more expensive. We explore the reasons behind firms' decisions to enhance product quality in the aftermath of financial misconduct. Our findings reveal a substantial decrease in sales and public perception post-fraud announcements, as evidenced by retail scanner data and Twitter analysis, pointing to a pressing need for reputation management among fraudulent firms. Further analyses rule out the possibility that quality enhancements are a result of firms optimizing their product portfolio to increase investment efficiency post-announcement. Overall, our evidence suggests that the observed improvements in product quality are primarily driven by firms' efforts to rebuild their reputation following the loss of credibility due to financial misconduct. Our study sheds light on the strategies firms employ to restore their reputations post-misconduct and the real economic impact of such behaviors on product markets.
