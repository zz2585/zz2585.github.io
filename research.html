                    This paper examines the impact of new revenue recognition standards on product prices. For identification, I exploit the staggered adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, a significant change in revenue recognition practices, to compare retail prices of products from manufacturers with different fiscal year-ends in a difference-in-differences analysis. Using micro-level retail scanner data, I find that manufacturers' adoption of ASC 606 is associated with increased retail prices. I hypothesize that the new standard's requirement for earlier recognition of certain trade promotions as revenue reductions discourages manufacturers from offering these incentives, leading retailers to pass through the higher effective wholesale price to consumers. Consistent with this hypothesis, the introduction of ASC 606 is associated with the absence of price effects in product markets with restricted trade promotions, stronger effects for retailers more exposed to adopting manufacturers, larger price increases in markets with specific competitive structures, and a shift in manufacturers' promotion strategies away from variable consideration promotions.

                    Retail traders can help or hinder the impounding of earnings information into price, but inferences are complicated because retail traders select when, where, and how much to trade. We use trade-level data and exploit retail brokerage outages to provide causal evidence on how retail investors affect the pricing of public earnings information. We find that retail trading is associated with stronger price responses to earnings news during the earnings announcement (EA) window and greater post-earnings announcement drift, but only the EA-window effect is robust to identification using plausibly exogenous outages. Outage-based results are stronger for earnings announcements expected to have high retail activity ex ante. Furthermore, retail buy-sell imbalance during EAs is not associated with price responses to earnings news, inconsistent with retail trade as informed per se. Overall, our evidence is consistent with a model in which retail trade, particularly when it is identifiable to market makers, facilitates liquidity provision to other traders around earnings announcements.

                    This study examines the impact of financial misconduct announcements on product quality. Using Amazon consumer reviews and difference-in-differences analyses, we show that product quality significantly improves for fraud firms after public announcements of misconduct. The observed effect is stronger when there is more media coverage, and for products that are either high-volume or more expensive. Exploring the reasons for enhanced product quality, we observe a significant decrease in sales and public perception post-fraud announcements. This highlights a need for reputation management in fraudulent firms to rebuild consumer trust. Our study sheds light on firms' strategies to restore their reputations post-misconduct and the real economic impact of such behaviors on product markets.
