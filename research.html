                </ul>
		<div style=<"font-size: 14pxfont-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">I study an effort by the Ecuadorian government to mitigate offshore tax avoidance through a tax havens outflows tax. First, I find that the 
		    outflows tax led to a sharp decrease in dividend payments to tax havens. I document a decrease by 66% in dividend payments sent to tax 
		    havens relative to non-havens following an increase in the relative cost of transacting with tax havens by 5%. I show that this drop implies 
		    net-of-tax elasticities of dividend payments abroad of between 13 and 40. Firms exposed to this legislative shock decreased overall dividend 
		    payouts by 50% and increased retained earnings in the short run by 600%. This response was largely unaccompanied by any change in post-tax 
		    investment behavior or extensive margin dividend payout behavior. Using administrative data on shareholder-company linkages to identify 
		    individuals highly connected to tax havens, I find that exposed individuals increased their domestic income reporting by 40% compared to 
		    the universe of unexposed taxpayers and paid 55% more in personal income taxes. This response was mainly driven by newly reported domestic 
		    capital and independent labor income flows and is consistent with a lasting reduction in offshore tax evasion. These results suggest the 
		    substantial scope for countries to act unilaterally in mitigating tax haven use and increasing tax collections.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">We use trade-level data and exploit retail brokerage outages to examine how retail investors affect the pricing of public earnings information. Retail trading is associated with stronger price responses to earnings news during the earnings announcement (EA) window and greater post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD), but only the EA-window effect is robust to identification using plausibly exogenous outages. Prior to earnings announcements, retail activity is associated with less informative returns, but retail buy-sell imbalance during EAs is not associated with price responses to earnings news. We discuss several potential theories of retail trade in light of our evidence. Overall, results are consistent with a theory of retail traders as noise traders who provide liquidity that can help or hinder the impounding of public earnings news into price, but inferences are complicated because retail traders select to trade on earnings characterized by PEAD, potentially due to attention or overconfidence.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;"> This study examines the impact of financial misconduct announcements on product quality and product portfolio in the consumer market. Using Amazon consumer reviews and difference-in-differences analyses, we show that product quality significantly increases for fraud firms after the announcements, particularly when the media coverage is higher and the products are high-volume or more expensive. Additionally, we observe that fraud firms adjust their product portfolio by reducing the number of products they sell and replacing brands on Amazon following the announcements. We also provide evidence for two potential reasons for these product strategy adjustments: to regain consumer trust after the loss of credibility due to financial misconduct and to improve investment efficiency by eliminating low-quality production lines. Our study sheds light on how firms can restore their reputations after misconduct and the real economic impact of such behavior on product strategy and social welfare.
