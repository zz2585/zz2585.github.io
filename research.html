		<div style=<"font-size: 14pxfont-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">I study an effort by the Ecuadorian government to mitigate offshore tax avoidance through a tax havens outflows tax. First, I find that the 
		    outflows tax led to a sharp decrease in dividend payments to tax havens. I document a decrease by 66% in dividend payments sent to tax 
		    havens relative to non-havens following an increase in the relative cost of transacting with tax havens by 5%. I show that this drop implies 
		    net-of-tax elasticities of dividend payments abroad of between 13 and 40. Firms exposed to this legislative shock decreased overall dividend 
		    payouts by 50% and increased retained earnings in the short run by 600%. This response was largely unaccompanied by any change in post-tax 
		    investment behavior or extensive margin dividend payout behavior. Using administrative data on shareholder-company linkages to identify 
		    individuals highly connected to tax havens, I find that exposed individuals increased their domestic income reporting by 40% compared to 
		    the universe of unexposed taxpayers and paid 55% more in personal income taxes. This response was mainly driven by newly reported domestic 
		    capital and independent labor income flows and is consistent with a lasting reduction in offshore tax evasion. These results suggest the 
		    substantial scope for countries to act unilaterally in mitigating tax haven use and increasing tax collections.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">Retail traders can help or hinder the impounding of earnings information into price, but inferences are complicated because retail traders select when, where, and how much to trade. We use trade-level data and exploit retail brokerage outages to provide causal evidence on how retail investors affect the pricing of public earnings information. We find that retail trading is associated with stronger price responses to earnings news during the earnings announcement (EA) window and greater post-earnings announcement drift, but only the EA-window effect is robust to identification using plausibly exogenous outages. Outage-based results are stronger for earnings announcements expected to have high retail activity ex ante. Furthermore, retail buy-sell imbalance during EAs is not associated with price responses to earnings news, inconsistent with retail trade as informed per se. Overall, our evidence is consistent with a model in which retail trade, particularly when it is identifiable to market makers, facilitates liquidity provision to other traders around earnings announcements.

		<div style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;"> This study examines the impact of financial misconduct announcements on product quality. Using Amazon consumer reviews and difference-in-differences analyses, we demonstrate that product quality significantly improves for fraud firms after the announcements, especially when the media coverage is higher and the products are high-volume or more expensive. Additionally, we provide evidence that efforts to rebuild reputation among consumers, following a loss of credibility due to financial misconduct, are likely the primary drivers of the observed improvements in product quality. Our study sheds light on the strategies firms employ to restore their reputations post-misconduct and the real economic impacts of such behaviors on consumers.
